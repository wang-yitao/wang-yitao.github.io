Welcome! I am **Yitao Wang** (çŽ‹é€¸å¼¢). I also go by my coffee name **Tony**. I am a PhD candidate in [Materials Science and Engineering](https://engineering.lehigh.edu/mse) at [Lehigh University](https://www2.lehigh.edu/), under the guidance of [Prof. Fadi Abdeljwad](https://engineering.lehigh.edu/faculty/fadi-abdeljawad). I leverage density functional thoery calculations and develop machine learning models and frameworks on supercomputers to drive our understanding and innovations in AI for physical sciences. Recently I work on the devlopement and benchmark of **foundation machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP)** and use them as a probe to understand and design ferroelectric materials and metal-salt interface in Gen IV molten salt fission reactors (MSRs).

**My research interests** more broadly lie in computational materials physics and chemistry at the atomic and molecular levels, with an emphasis on the theory and application of *ab-initio* calculations, molecular dynamics, and AI/ML to tackle challenges across energy, materials, pharmaceutics, devices, and computing.

**Previously** I earned my BS in [Marine Engineering](https://mec.dlmu.edu.cn/) at Dalian Maritime University(https://www.dlmu.edu.cn/) and MS in [Mechanical Engineering](https://www.clemson.edu/cecas/departments/me/) at [Clemson University](https://www.clemson.edu/) under the supervision of [Prof. Zhaoxu Meng](https://cecas.clemson.edu/~zmeng/).

**Yes!** I had an *unorthodox* transition from "civil" to "materials science" (they are at the opposite ends of spectrum in terms of the length scale if you will) after years of working with Prof. Chang in civil engineering department because he is too nice and I was too numb not seeing what I really want to pursue, thanks to the spoon-feeding education system in Taiwan and my self-deception from the uninformed, vague childhood interest in civil structure ðŸ™ƒ. Fortunately, I had Prof. Chang's unwavering guidance that enlightened me to use my gift and interest for fundamental science and technology. :stars:

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too.
